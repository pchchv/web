/*
The web package is a lightweight framework for building web applications.
It has a multiplexer, a mechanism for connecting middleware, and its own context management.
The main goal of web is to get as far away from the developer as possible,
i.e. it doesn't force you to build your application according to any particular template,
but just helps you make all the trivial things faster and easier.
e.g.
1. Getting named URI parameters.
2. Multiplexer for regex-matching URIs and the like.
3. Implementation of special application-level configurations or any similar objects into the request context as required.
